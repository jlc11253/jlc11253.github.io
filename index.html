        <h2>Join Vic and Joe in August 2026 to celebrate a wedding!</h2>
        <p>We are so excited to welcome you all to Cardiff to celebrate us (finally) getting married. All the details you need will hopefully be here, but if you have any other questions at all just drop us a call or a whatsapp. 
			<br><br>We'll be kicking off from 5pm at JRG, and there will be an ice-cream van on arrival to help tackle the august heat - just show them your invite to get a scoop. Dinner will be provided so all you need to bring is yourself, and a card/cash if you'd like to buy drinks.
		<br><br>We'll wrap up by midnight. At the moment the last trains from Cardiff Central aren't that late, so if you are travelling you'll either have to leave early (boo) or book somewhere to stay and close out the night (yay). Suggestions for accomodation below, but if you're coming from further away why not take a long weekend and make the most of being in the greatest country on earth? We have coffee and food recs if you do.
		<br><br>We'll be dressed up for the wedding, and would love you to do the same, but also make sure you're comfortable and happy - it's a summer wedding on a rooftop after all! While the inside portion of the venue is accessible, please be advised that to reach the roof garden you will need to climb a single flight of stairs - if you need a hand to make this happen just drop us a line and we'll do what we can.
		</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:left;color:black;">FAQs</h2>


				
				<p>
					<u>Is there parking at the venue?</u>
				<br>There is very limited paid parking right outside, but it is right in the middle of town so you could easily walk from the station, or John Lewis or St David's car parks.
				<br><br><br>
				
				<u>What if I have dietary requirements?</u>
				<br>The food will be streetfood style and we will have covered all of the usual suspects (vegan, veggie etc) but if you have anything specific you think we should know about drop us a message asap and we'll pass it on to the caterers.
				<br><br><br>
				
				<u>What about your ceremony?</u>
				<br>We are doing a <em>very</em> small ceremony, with our main celebration being this evening party. Don't worry, Joe is still threatening to do a speech.
				<br><br><br>

					
				<u>Can I bring a plus one?</u>
				<br>We are quite tight on numbers, so the invite is for whoever we addressed it to when we sent it.
				<br><br><br>
				
				<u>Can I bring my kids?</u>
				<br>Potentially! Drop us a message.
					<br><br><br>

				<u>Is Mali coming?</u>
				<br>She is, and she fully expects to be the centre of attention for the entire day.

		<p class="greenbox_text" style="text-align: justify;">Cardiff has loads of options for places to sleep (including all the usual chains), but here are some nice places within walking distance of the venue. If you're coming for a few days and fancy a quieter stay, you should also consider Dinas Powys or Penarth.</p>
