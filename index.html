        <h2><strong>Vic and Joe request the pleasure of your company as they get married in the beautiful Bannau Brycheiniog.</strong></h2>
        <p>We are so excited to spend this day surrounded by our closest friends and family, and would be honored if you would attend. The dress code is whatever you feel comfortable in, but we will be dressed formally, in our wedding best. It is worth noting that we will be getting married on a working farm â€“ so wear heels at your own risk!</p>
